      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Achieving Productivity Improvements That Stick</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">
        Today many organizations are looking to improve profitability by not only focusing on increasing revenue, (which is getting more difficult in these tough economic times) but by squeezing that last drop of "production efficiency" from their day to day Operations. The challenge has always been to make such improvement gains "stick".

    <!-- Challenges Section -->
    <div class="mb-16">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">The Challenges</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
        Operations are the heart of most businesses. This is where the "rubber meets the road." All the promises made to customers and shareholders can be fulfilled or destroyed in Operations. Although what needs to be done here might appear straight forward, it is an area fraught with many challenges and unfulfilled expectations:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 text-gray-600 mb-8">
        <li>Inconsistency of product or service offerings</li>
        <li>Waste, activities or resources that do not add value to an external customer</li>
        <li>Failure to consistently meet delivery schedules, mounting backlogs, high Turn Around Times (TAT)</li>
        <li>Poor quality of final product</li>
        <li>Poor resource and capacity planning</li>
        <li>Low Customer Satisfaction Levels</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-600">
        If managers do not manage the above then they find themselves in a never ending spiral of "chasing their tails." Throwing additional resources to the problem appears to make things worse. The end result is low staff morale as it appears to them that they never win. Senior executives looking to reduce expenses look to this struggling environment to cut costs. An Operation is always expected to do more with less. The end result is usually an unhappy customer who leaves for a competitor who might not even be better than us.

    <!-- Solution Section -->
    <div class="mb-16">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">The Solution</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
        The solution lies in making effective changes in how the operation environment is run by focusing on Performance Improvement. The science of improvement is actually based on making informed and intelligent change. All improvement will require change, but not all change will result in improvement.
